<h1> The Office Card Game </h1>
I created and designed a matching card game with my favorite TV show, The Office.

How it's made Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice I created a couple objects in javaScript. My newest challenge when I was creating this game was learning how to make array shuffles.

Lesson Learned No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. I learned how to use more OOP with this project.
